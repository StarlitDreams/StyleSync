Based on the clothes in your closet, I suggest the following outfit for your college and date with your girlfriend:

- Top: Blue shirt full sleeve
- Bottom: Black jeans levis
- Accessory: Adidas Originals shoes

This outfit will give you a casual yet fashionable look. The blue shirt will make you look smart and confident. The black jeans will complement the shirt and make you look trendy. The Adidas Originals shoes will finish off the outfit and give you a sporty look.

I hope you will have a great time at college and on your date with your girlfriend. Enjoy your day!
